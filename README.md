# Hey, I'm Francesco 👋

**Co-Founder & CTO** at [Luxxera](https://luxxera.com) • **Founder** at [Alowh](https://alowh.com) • **Fractional CTO**

For most people, it's coffee, but for me, it's **chocolate milk**. I usually drink at least two glasses a day — it's the fuel that pushes my creativity for impactful products.

### What I Do

I help startups and early-stage companies turn ideas into scalable products. My focus is on building strong technical foundations — whether that's architecting web applications, creating design systems that scale, or setting up infrastructure that allows a product to grow without breaking.

As a CTO and technical founder type, I go beyond just building websites: I guide startups in making the right technical decisions early on, bridging the gap between business vision and practical execution.
